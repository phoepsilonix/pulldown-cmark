# Superscript and subscript

Basic strikethrough is between two tildes:

```````````````````````````````` example_super_sub
^This is super^ ~This is sub~
.
<p><sup>This is super</sup> <sub>This is sub</sub></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example_super_sub
~This is stricken out~
.
<p><sub>This is stricken out</sub></p>
````````````````````````````````

Backslash escapes:

```````````````````````````````` example_super_sub
~This is \~stricken~
.
<p><sub>This is ~stricken</sub></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example_super_sub
~This~is~nothing~
.
<p><sub>This~is~nothing</sub></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example_super_sub
~This ~~is stricken.~
.
<p><sub>This ~~is stricken.</sub></p>
````````````````````````````````

The first one wins.

```````````````````````````````` example_super_sub
~This ~~is stricken~ but this is not~~
.
<p><sub>This ~~is stricken</sub> but this is not~~</p>
````````````````````````````````
