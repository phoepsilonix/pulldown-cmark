# Detailed Specifications

Pulldown-cmark's test suite follows the convention,
set by CommonMark itself, of writing specifications
that double as conformance tests.

The CommonMark Specification is copied from
<https://spec.commonmark.org>, but slightly modified
because pulldown-cmark and cmark don't escape special
characters in the exact same way (though their results
are identical when rendered with a web browser).

The "GitHub" specifications have been excerpted from
<https://github.github.com/gfm/>.
